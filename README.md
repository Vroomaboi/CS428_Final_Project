# CS428_Final_Project
 ## A basic http proxy server
 In our program we allow a client to divert their http request through our proxy server to the destination server, we than send back the server's response and/or error messaging. Our server logs all of these connections in the proxy.log file. 

 To use our program, you compile with make:
 > make

 Than to run, you must specify a port to run on:
 > ./proxy (port_number)
